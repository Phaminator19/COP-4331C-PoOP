# COP 4331 - Processes of Object Oriented Programming

## Group 25: Project 1: Group Matching App

Welcome to our repository!

## Overview
In this project, the users should be able to create a profile with their interests and come together with other users and create similar interest groups. Then, the app suggests groups or users to other groups based on their common interests, so they can communicate through the app and organize events. It can be accessed via a web browser and/or mobile app. You can create events, including details such as time, duration, location, and so on. The users also can share photos related to the event and these should be accessible only to those that have attended the event.
